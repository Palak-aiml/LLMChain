# LLMChain UI Tools

This UI provides:
- A visual chain builder (drag-and-drop prototype)
- A dashboard for metrics and traces

## Usage

1. Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:
   ```
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```
2. Run the backend:
   ```
   uvicorn ui.app:app --reload
   ```
3. Open your browser at http://localhost:8000

The UI is a prototype and can be extended for full visual editing and monitoring.
